Linux File System Organization Exercise
Overview
This project focuses on creating and managing directories and files in a Linux environment. The objective was to organize and structure directories for workstations, servers, and user files using basic Linux commands. These skills are fundamental in system administration and provide hands-on experience in managing file systems.

Commands Used
mkdir: Create directories
cd: Change directories
touch: Create files
ls: List directory contents
tree: View directory structure in a tree format
Directory and File Structure
The following directories and files were created during the exercise:

Directories:

workstations
servers
users
Other directories as required
Files:

User files for fred, daphne, scrappy, and velma
Files representing workstations and servers
Objective
The goal of this exercise was to:

Create and organize directories and files using basic Linux commands.
Structure the file system for workstations, servers, and user data.
Verify the structure using the tree command to ensure correct organization.
Learning Outcomes
Gained hands-on experience with essential Linux commands (mkdir, cd, touch, ls, tree).
Developed a deeper understanding of file system organization and structure.
Improved skills in managing files and directories in a Linux environment.
Usage
To view the directory structure, use the following commands:

$ tree
To navigate through directories, use:

$ cd <directory_name>
To list the contents of a directory:

$ ls
To create a new file:

$ touch <file_name>
Conclusion
This exercise provided a solid foundation in using Linux commands to organize and manage files and directories. The experience gained will be useful for future system administration tasks.
